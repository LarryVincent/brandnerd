<p class="story-style">The long holiday weekend provided me the opportunity to start work on the next season of <a href="http://playpodca.st/findingsreport"><em>The Findings Report</em></a>, the podcast that I produce with <a href="https://www.mollyschreiber.com">Molly Schreiber</a>. In case you haven’t listened in, the show is a deep dive on consumer psychology. Each episode examines why people buy, like and share through the lens of a specific behavioral trend. Ok, enough with the plug. Back to my long weekend work.</p>
<p class="story-style">We produce the show in a seasonal format. The episodes aren’t episodic, but because the show is a hobby, and not my full-time job, seasons help us create and deliver content in batches. We drop a new show every week over the course of nine consecutive weeks. We’ve found this format streamlines our production process, which I thought I would share here for others who might be thinking about producing a podcast of their own.</p>
<div id="story-planning" class="section level1">
<h1>Story Planning</h1>
<p class="story-style">Arguably, one of the hardest parts of the process is the first few weeks. During that time we create a long list of show ideas. Molly and I each share thoughts through numerous email exchanges. Last season, we also collaborated with my colleagues Valerie Cabrera Krause and Grady Lopez. This season, we took it one step further and organized a brainstorming lunch to pitch and discuss our various ideas.</p>
<p class="story-style">The process is tricky because our show aims for a degree of journalistic rigor. We’re not a talking heads show. It isn’t Molly and I in a room riffing on whatever is on our mind. Instead, every show is a carefully orchestrated mix of interviews with expert guests, sound bites from popular culture and heard-on-the-street interviews with real consumers. In the planning phase, we pitch ideas that interest us but we also add the mandate that there needs to be some nugget of insight that validates its importance to listeners. That could be a new book by an expert, or a piece of research, or a demonstrable trend that’s backed by data. For every episode, we try to ensure we have satisfied the following five criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>The story is anchored to a strong question</li>
<li>There is a backbone of research behind the content–often shared by the guests</li>
<li>The story and the research connect to our focus on consumer psychology and behavior</li>
<li>There are multiple layers of sound–many voices, field influence, scoring</li>
<li>There is a good story structure–the listeners takes a journey with us and hopefully encounters a twist or two</li>
</ul>
<p class="story-style">Once we have at least nine story ideas, the real fun begins. We start searching for guests. A good show has a diverse mix. We look for people from different backgrounds and, as this is an audio show, contrasting voices.</p>
</div>
<div id="booking" class="section level1">
<h1>Booking</h1>
<p class="story-style">Sometimes, finding a guest is a no-brainer. One of us knows someone. We read an article and tracked down the author. Someone in our network recommended someone else. After 18 shows, we’ve recently started getting recommendations from previous guests. Over the next few weeks, it’s a constant back and forth of emails and phone calls.</p>
</div>
<div id="scheduling" class="section level1">
<h1>Scheduling</h1>
<p class="story-style">While the hunt for guests goes on, we sketch out a season plan (see below). It takes us about 16-20 weeks to produce a season. In our first season, all of the content was “in the can” when we launched. That included all interviews, narration and field work. We got a little more fluid last season, with a staggered production schedule that had us launch before many of the shows were finished. We still had all of the interviews completed before we launched.</p>

<p class="story-style">Our production schedule flows in stages. First is the planning and booking. That’s followed by a pretty intense interview phase. For season #2 we completed about 22 interviews in the scope of 30 days! It wasn’t nearly as bad as it sounds. The hardest part is coordinating schedules with the guest and locating a good recording studio in their area, or finding an engineer to travel to the guest’s office or home. <a href="https://airmedia.org">AIR</a> has been a god-send for us. It is more than worth the price of membership. We’ve found great collaborators all over the planet.</p>
<p class="story-style">Once the interviews are complete, we move into story mode. We transcribe the interviews and then brainstorm a narrative for the show. Spoiler: our shows are loosely scripted. We work hard to make it sound otherwise. Before we talk amongst ourselves, we spend a lot of time combing the transcripts and listening to the interview tape to find the right snippets that drive the story. Then, Molly and I trade drafts of a script. I write my side of the conversation and she writes hers. When we get in the studio, we often improvise. But we always have a script.</p>
<p class="story-style">Finally, once the narration is recorded, we move to editing. It takes at least a week to edit all the tape together, mix and score a show. While I once dreaded editing, it’s now one of my favroite parts of the process. The key for me is organization. I log all of my tape before I cut anything. Then, it’s a matter of listening over and over again.</p>

<div id="prepping-for-season-three" class="section level1">
<h1>Prepping for Season Three</h1>
<p class="story-style">Sometimes I think I’m a glutton for punishment. At the start of the production process the work required can be overwhelming. Now that we’ve done a couple, I feel a bit like Sisyphus because I know what’s coming. However, once we get started there’s a momentum and energy that brews and carries us through the process. We’re covering some fun topics in the coming season, so I doubt there will be any room for boredom.</p>
