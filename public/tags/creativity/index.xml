      <description>The long holiday weekend provided me the opportunity to start work on the next season of The Findings Report, the podcast that I produce with Molly Schreiber. If you haven’t listed in, the show is a deep dive on consumer psychology. Each episode examines why people buy, like and share through the lens of a specific behavioral trend. Ok, enough with the plug. Back to my long weekend work.</description>

      <description>I’ve made a career out of categorizing and labeling things. That’s what branding is, when you get right down to it. Whether it’s a widget or an experience, your goal as a brand strategist is to help people think about a product or service in a certain categorical context, and then associate it with a distinctive name and identity.
I’ve been doing this for over 25 years. That’s why I find it funny that I struggle to categorize and label myself.</description>
