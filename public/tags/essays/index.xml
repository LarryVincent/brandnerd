      <description>I believe I was once quoted saying, “I need another blog like I need a hole in my head.” I don’t quite recall where that was quoted or by whom, but the sentiment is true. I have a couple of blogs. So, why start another?
The answer could easily be, “because I can.” But it’s a little more nuanced than that. The truth is that I feel boxed in by my current blogs.</description>
