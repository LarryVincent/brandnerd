      <description>I’ve made a career out of categorizing and labeling things. That’s what branding is, when you get right down to it. Whether it’s a widget or an experience, your goal as a brand strategist is to help people think about a product or service in a certain categorical context, and then associate it with a distinctive name and identity.
I’ve been doing this for over 25 years. That’s why I find it funny that I struggle to categorize and label myself.</description>

      <description>I believe I was once quoted saying, “I need another blog like I need a hole in my head.” I don’t quite recall where that was quoted or by whom, but the sentiment is true. I have a couple of blogs. So, why start another?
The answer could easily be, “because I can.” But it’s a little more nuanced than that. The truth is that I feel boxed in by my current blogs.</description>
